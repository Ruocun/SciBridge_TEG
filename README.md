# SciBridge_TEG

# The TEG team in SciBridge is building a software package to simulate the power output of a commercial TEG module under the effect of different heat dissipation, thermal interfaces, and TE materials. 

# Current progress:
# We are in the stage of building the model, simulating heat dissipation using 3D finite element modeling, measuring the thermal transport properties of the TEG module experimentally, and learning github in order to perform proper collaborative coding development in the future.
